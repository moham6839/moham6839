# Hello there 👋

**My name is Mohamed Hassan**. I recently completed a Data Science Master's program at CUNY School of Professional Studies, trained in using Python, R, and SQL. Previously, I completed a Data Science bootcamp program at Flatiron School. I consider the work I've created passion projects, focused on various areas of basketball and topics that are important to public health and transportation. I am also a Train Operator for the City of New York, getting people where they have to go. I previously worked for the FDNY as an EMT/911 Dispatcher 🚑. I have a passion for problem solving, using data and math to discover impactful solutions to complex problems.



- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of Machine Learning projects.
- 👐 Open to working with others on finding solutions that impact society. 
- 💬 Ask me about my favorite NBA basketball team 🏀
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 4 cats 😸
